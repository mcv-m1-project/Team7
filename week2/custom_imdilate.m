% Function: custom_imdilate
% Description: custom dilation operation
% Input: image, se
% Output: image dilated
function image_dilated = custom_imdilate(image, se)
% Get integer sizes of structuring element
[m, n] = size(se);
% Divided by 2 in order to adjust local window into image
m = floor(m/2);
n = floor(n/2);

% Add value 0 on borders of images
image = padarray(image, [m n]);
% Initialize to 0 dilated image
image_dilated = false(size(image));
% Get sizes of dilated image
[max_i, max_j] = size(image);

% Set max_i and max_j iterations to iterate inside of image
max_i = max_i-(2*m);
max_j = max_j-(2*n);

% Iterate pixel by pixel of image
for i=1:max_i
    for j=1:max_j
        window = image(i:i+(2*m),j:j+(2*n));   % Get window
        max_value = max(max(window&se));       % Get local MAXIMUM
        image_dilated(i,j) = max_value;        % Assing pixel value to image
    end

% Resize image dilated
