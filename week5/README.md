# Week5

  - task1(). Geometric Heuristics. Squares & Triangles: Hough for lines + heuristics. 
	Circles: Hough for circles. Object-based evaluation (MScProj-DB-System)
	(precision, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity)
  
  - task2(). Improve segmentation. Replace the color segmentation from previous blocks with other
	segmentation algorithm. Consider the bounding box of each region as a window candidate and use
	color or geometric features to remove regions not likely to contain traffic signals
